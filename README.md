MFFA-SMG-FL: Segmented Multimodal Federated Learning Framework for Adaptive Intrusion Detection in IoT and Edge Networks
•	IoT-IDS (Tabular): This dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azalhowaide/iot-dataset-for-intrusion-detection-systems-ids) includes traffic data from various IoT devices, incorporating features such as DeviceName, Attack, and AttackSubType. The data is windowed over 10-second intervals, with binary class labels (0 for attack, 1 for normal).
•	SIDD (Image-Based): The Segmented Image-based Network Intrusion Detection (SIDD) dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuweisunut/sidd-segmented-intrusion-detection-dataset) consists of 48×48 grayscale images representing 128-second network activity snapshots from 15 geographically distributed monitoring points. These images capture multiprotocol traffic dynamics for both benign and anomalous patterns.
•	Edge-IIoTset (Tabular): This tabular dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sibasispradhan/edge-iiotset-dataset) simulates industrial IoT environments with a diverse set of traffic patterns and attack scenarios. It supports both centralized and federated learning experiments, making it highly suitable for evaluating edge-centric intrusion detection strategies.
